# ZKSync MultiChain Transactions

This tutorial focuses on helping developers harness the power of Thirdweb's account abstraction and multi-chain features to create web3 applications that offer an effortless user experience across various EVM-compatible networks. By utilizing multi-chain account abstraction wallets, developers can unlock several benefits, such as:

Seamless cross-chain experiences: Users can switch between different chains without having to worry about managing multiple wallets or addresses.
Support for tokens/NFTs on different chains: Developers can enable users to interact with tokens and NFTs on multiple networks, expanding the functionality and reach of their applications.
Unified in-app wallets: By creating in-app wallets that support multiple chains, developers can provide a cohesive and convenient experience for their users, making it easier for them to manage their digital assets within the application.
